Contrary to initial feedback, NKG7 (47.22%) and CST7 (47.22%) are actually expressed at levels higher than other clusters, confirming NK identity. The presence of CD3D/CD3E/CD247 likely represents technical artifacts or rare NK-T interactions rather than true T cell identity, as evidenced by complete absence of TRDC/TRGC1 (0%). FCGR3A (CD16) expression at 36.11% supports classical NK identity, though lower than expected. The platelet marker GP9 suggests potential platelet-NK doublets or platelet contamination. The cytotoxic profile combined with NKG7/CST7 expression outweighs the conflicting T cell markers, while the platelet markers likely represent technical artifacts rather than biological identity."

The complete absence of CD11B (ITGAM) expression is unexpected but may reflect technical limitations or a specific activation state, as classical monocytes can downregulate CD11B during certain inflammatory conditions. The lack of neutrophil markers (ELANE, MPO) rules out neutrophil precursor contamination. While CD163 absence suggests these are not mature macrophages, this is consistent with classical monocytes that typically express lower CD163 levels. The inflammatory signature (S100A8/A9, IFITM3) and absence of alternative lineage markers strongly support an activated classical monocyte identity. The original label '1' likely reflects this being a major myeloid population in PBMC samples."

"2"	"2"	"Doublet (B-T cell, HLA-DR-high)"	"CL_0000960"	"B cell-T cell doublet with HLA-DR-high expression"	"mixed"	"The cluster shows conflicting marker expression patterns that cannot be explained by a single cell type. While there is strong expression of B cell markers (MS4A1 at 52.63%, CD79A at 47.37%, CD79B at 63.16%), the unexpectedly low CD19 expression (21.05%) and presence of T cell markers (CD3E at 42.11%, CD3D at 26.32%) suggest this is not a pure B cell population. The complete absence of CD20 expression contradicts the initial CD20-positive annotation. The HLA-DR-high expression could come from either activated B cells or T cells. The balanced distribution between groups and presence of both B and T cell markers strongly suggests this cluster represents technical doublets rather than a biologically meaningful cell state. The heterogeneity status further supports this interpretation."
